					<h2>Stephen Monaghan: YAPL Programming Language</h2>

					<p>
						YAPL is a programming language that is designed to work with drones for easy error recovery.  It is based around a finite state machine, meaning that the programmer will write their programs to accomplish small tasks in each state.  These are then chained together to accomplish a larger task.  It comes with a simple and easy to use drone library that works with the parrot AR drone, sending commands to the drone through a nodejs server.  Because it is state based, the program constantly monitors the current state of the system and backs it up.  That way if there is an error, a second copy of the program can be started up in the same state, and continue execution as if nothing had gone wrong in the first place.
